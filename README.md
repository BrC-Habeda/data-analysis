## Description

I have prepared a summary of new ways to look at data that will try and make it more like oil in the hopes that we will one day have a new appreciation of the oil rigs in the permian basin and the contribution of George P. Mitchell.

## Definition

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves the **collection**, **analysis**, **interpretation, presentation**, and **organization** of data. It plays a crucial role in various fields, including science, business, economics, social sciences, and more.
The goal of statistics is to **extract meaningful information from data**, make inferences, and **support decision-making processes**.
We are going to focus on the extraction of "meaningful" information from data and support the decision-making processes.

As trivial as it may be, defining meaningful information is a necessary step in understanding the misconceptions we have built (for good reason) thus far.

**Meaningful information** - information that _contributes to decision-making, problem-solving, or achieving specific goals_.

The concept of meaningful information underscores the importance of quality over quantity. It emphasizes the idea that _not all information is equally valuable, and the focus should be on acquiring, processing, and utilizing information that has real significance and utility in a given context_

Descriptive statistics provide a summary of key aspects of a dataset, making it easier to understand and interpret. However, it's important to note that ease of understanding and interpretation do not allow for the generalization of findings to a larger population; for that purpose, inferential statistics are often used.

```bash
npm install
