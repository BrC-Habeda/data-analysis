## Description

I have prepared a summary of new ways to look at data that will try and make it more like oil in the hopes that we will one day have a new appreciation of the oil rigs in the permian basin and the contribution of George P. Mitchell.

## Definition

Statistics encompasses the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data, serving a pivotal role in diverse fields such as science, business, and social sciences.

The core objective of statistics is to extract _meaningful information that contributes to decision-making, problem-solving, and specific goal attainment_.

**Meaningful information** is defined as data that _significantly_ supports decision-making, problem-solving, or goal achievement.

This emphasis on meaningful information highlights the critical importance of data quality, emphasizing the need to prioritize information acquisition, processing, and utilization that holds genuine significance and utility in decision-making and problem-solving.

Practitioners are tasked with minimizing the use of data lacking significance in organizational decision-making and problem-solving processes.

Consider the following SQL query

```bash
SELECT students.student_id, students.name, students.class, SUM(marks.marks) AS total_marks
FROM students
INNER JOIN marks ON students.student_id = marks.student_id
WHERE students.year = 2023 AND students.class = 6
GROUP BY students.student_id, students.name
ORDER BY total_marks DESC;
```

This SQL query ðŸ‘† efficiently identifies the student with the highest marks in class 6, aligning with the school's objective. (Recognize and award high achievers)

The adaptability of data collection, processing, and analysis is emphasized, tailored to the specific problems being addressed.
