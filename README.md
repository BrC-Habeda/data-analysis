## Definition

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves the **collection**, **analysis**, **interpretation, presentation**, and **organization** of data. It plays a crucial role in various fields, including science, business, economics, social sciences, and more. The goal of statistics is to extract meaningful information from data, make inferences, and **support decision-making processes**.

```bash
npm install
